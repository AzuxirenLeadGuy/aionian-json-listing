   "17": "So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations, and from David until the Babylonian captivity are fourteen generations, and from the Babylonian captivity until the Christ are fourteen generations.",
   "18": "Now the birth of Jesus Christ was like this: After His mother Mary was betrothed to Joseph, before they joined together, she was found to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit.",
   "19": "Then Joseph her husband, being a just man and not wanting to humiliate her publicly, decided to repudiate her secretly.",
   "20": "But while he pondered these things, wow, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream saying: “Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to receive Mary as your wife, because that which has been conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit.",
   "21": "And she will give birth to a Son and you will call His name Jesus, because He will save His people from their sins.”",

   "3": "When Herod the king heard it he became agitated, and all Jerusalem with him.",
   "4": "And gathering all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born.",
   "5": "So they said to him: “In Bethlehem of Judea, for thus it stands written by the prophet:",
   "6": "‘And you, Bethlehem, land of Judah, are not at all the least among the rulers of Judah, for out of you will come a Ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.’”",
   "7": "Then Herod, calling the wise men secretly, determined from them the time when the star appeared.",
   "8": "And directing them to Bethlehem he said, “When you get there, search carefully for the young child; and should you find him, bring back word to me, so that I also may go and worship him.”",
   "9": "So having heard the king they departed, and there was the star that they had seen in the East! It went before them until it arrived and stopped above where the young Child was.",
   "10": "Now when they saw the star they rejoiced with exceedingly great joy!",
   "11": "And coming into the house they saw the young Child with Mary His mother, and falling down they worshiped Him; and opening their treasures they presented gifts to Him: gold, frankincense and myrrh.",
   "12": "Then, having been warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed for their own country by a different road.",
   "13": "Now when they had departed, again, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream saying: “Get up, take the young Child and His mother, flee to Egypt and stay there until I tell you; because Herod is about to seek the young Child to destroy Him!”",
   "14": "So he got up and took the young Child and His mother by night and departed for Egypt.",
   "15": "And he was there until the death of Herod, so that what was spoken by the Lord through the prophet should be fulfilled, namely: “Out of Egypt I called my Son.”",
   "16": "Then Herod, when he saw that he had been deceived by the wise men, became very angry, and he sent out and killed all the boys who were in Bethlehem and in all its districts, from two years old and under, according to the time which he had determined from the wise men.",
   "17": "Then what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet was fulfilled, namely:",
   "18": "“A voice was heard in Ramah, lamentation, weeping and great mourning; Rachel weeping for her children and not wanting to be comforted, because they are no more.”",
   "19": "Now Herod having died, there, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt",
   "20": "saying: “Get up, take the young Child and His mother and go into the land of Israel, for those seeking the life of the young Child have died.”",
   "21": "So he got up and took the young Child and His mother and went into the land of Israel.",
   "22": "But hearing that Archelaus was reigning over Judea instead of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream he proceeded into the region of Galilee.",
   "23": "And upon arriving he settled in a city called Natsareth [Branch-town], so that what was spoken through the prophets should be fulfilled, that He would be called a Natsorean [Branch-man]."

   "1": "Now in those days John the Baptizer began preaching in the wilderness of Judea",
   "2": "and saying, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has come near!”",
   "3": "For this is he who was referred to by the prophet Isaiah, saying: “A voice crying-out, ‘Prepare in the wilderness the way of the Lord, make His paths straight.’”",
   "4": "Now John actually used clothes made from camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist; while his food was locusts and wild honey.",
   "5": "Then Jerusalem, all Judea and all the region of the Jordan went out to him,",
   "6": "and were being baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.",
   "7": "But seeing many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them: “Brood of vipers! Who tipped you off to flee from the coming wrath?",
   "8": "Therefore produce fruit worthy of repentance,",
   "9": "and don't even think to say within yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as father,’ for I say to you that God is able to raise up children to Abraham from these stones.",
   "10": "Indeed, already the ax is being laid to the root of the trees. So every tree not producing good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.",
   "11": "“I baptize you with water unto repentance, but the One coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with Holy Spirit.",
   "12": "His winnowing shovel is in His hand, and He will thoroughly clean out His threshing floor and gather His wheat into the barn; but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”",
   "13": "Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan to be baptized by him.",
   "14": "But John tried to dissuade Him saying, “I have need to be baptized by You, and You are coming to me?”",
   "15": "But in answer Jesus said to him, “Permit it now, because thus it is appropriate to us to fulfill all righteousness.” Then he permitted Him.",
   "16": "And having been baptized Jesus came up directly from the water, when wow, the heavens were opened to Him, and he saw the Spirit of God coming down like a dove and alighting upon Him.",
   "17": "And wow, a Voice from the heavens saying, “This is my Son, the beloved, in whom I am always well pleased!”"

   "1": "Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tested by the devil.",
   "2": "And having fasted forty days and forty nights, afterward He was hungry.",
   "3": "And coming to Him the tempter said, “Since you are the Son of God, command that these stones become loaves of bread.”",
   "4": "But in answer He said, “It is written: ‘Man shall not live on bread alone, but by every word coming out of God's mouth.’”",
   "5": "Then the devil takes Him into the holy city and sets Him upon the pinnacle of the temple,",
   "6": "and says to Him, “Since you are the Son of God, throw yourself down; for it is written: ‘He will give orders to His angels about you, and they will lift you up on their hands, lest you strike your foot against a stone.’”",
   "7": "Jesus said to him, “It is also written: ‘You shall not test the Lord your God!’”",
   "8": "Again the devil takes Him to a very high mountain and shows Him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.",
   "9": "And he says to Him, “All these things I will give to you, if You will fall down and worship me.”",
   "10": "Then Jesus says to him: “Get behind me, Satan! For it is written: ‘You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve.’”",
   "11": "Then the devil leaves Him, and then, angels came and began ministering to Him.",
   "12": "Now hearing that John had been put in prison, Jesus departed into Galilee.",
   "13": "And leaving Natsareth behind, He went and took up residence in Capernaum by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali;",
   "14": "so that what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet should be fulfilled, namely:",
   "15": "“Land of Zebulun and land of Naphtali, way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the nations!",
   "16": "The people sitting in darkness saw a great light, and upon those sitting in the place and shadow of death light has dawned.”",
   "17": "From then on Jesus began to preach and to say, “Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has come near.”",
   "18": "And walking by the Sea of Galilee He saw two brothers, Simon (the one called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a circular net into the sea (for they were fishermen).",
   "19": "And He says to them, “Follow me and I will make you fishers of men.”",
   "20": "So leaving the nets immediately they followed Him.",
   "21": "And going on from there He saw two other brothers, James (the one of Zebedee) and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets. And He called them.",
   "22": "So leaving the boat and their father immediately they followed Him.",
   "23": "Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the Gospel of the Kingdom, and healing every disease and every illness among the people.",
   "24": "So His fame went throughout all Syria; and they brought to Him all who were sick—suffering with various diseases and torments, and being demonized and being moonstruck, and paralytics—and He healed them.",
   "25": "So large crowds followed Him—from Galilee and Decapolis and Jerusalem and Judea and beyond the Jordan."
  },
  "5": {
   "1": "Now seeing the crowds He went up on the mountain, and upon His sitting down His disciples approached Him.",
   "2": "And opening His mouth He started teaching them, saying:",
   "3": "“Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.",
   "4": "Blessed are those who mourn, for they will be comforted.",
   "5": "Blessed are the meek, for they will inherit the earth.",
   "6": "Blessed are those hungering and thirsting for righteousness, for they will be filled.",
   "7": "Blessed are the merciful, for they will be shown mercy.",
   "8": "Blessed are the pure in heart, for they will see God.",
   "9": "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they will be called sons of God.",
   "10": "Blessed are those who have been persecuted on account of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.",
   "11": "“Blessed are you when they revile and persecute you, and speak all kinds of evil against you, lying, because of Me.",
   "12": "Rejoice and exult, because your reward in the heavens is great, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.",
   "13": "You are the salt of the earth; but if the salt becomes insipid with what will it be salted? It is then good for nothing except to be thrown out and trampled down by the people.",
   "14": "You are the light of the world. A city located upon a hill cannot be hidden.",
   "15": "Nor do they light a lamp and place it under the hamper, but on the lampstand, and it shines on everything in the house.",
   "16": "So also let your light shine before the people, so that they may see your good works and may glorify your Father, who is in the heavens.",
   "17": "“Do not suppose that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets; I did not come to destroy but to fulfill.",
   "18": "For assuredly I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not one iota nor one tittle shall pass away from the Law until everything happens.",
   "19": "Therefore, whoever annuls one of the least of these commandments and teaches that to the people will be called least in the kingdom of the heavens; but whoever does and teaches them, he will be called great in the kingdom of the heavens.",
   "20": "For I say to you that unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees you will absolutely not enter the kingdom of the heavens!",
   "21": "“You have heard that it was said to the ancients, ‘You shall not murder, so whoever murders will be liable to the judgment.’",
   "22": "But I say to you that whoever gets angry with his brother without cause will be liable to the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, ‘Numbskull!’ will be liable to the council. But whoever says, ‘You absolute idiot!’ will be liable to hell fire.",
   "23": "Therefore, if you bring your gift to the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you,",
   "24": "leave your gift there before the altar and go; first be reconciled with your brother and then, returning, offer your gift.",
   "25": "Be agreeable to your adversary quickly, while you are on the way with him, lest the adversary hand you over to the judge, and the judge hand you over to the officer, and you be thrown into prison.",
   "26": "Assuredly I say to you, you will by no means get out of there until you have paid the last penny.",
   "27": "“You have heard that it was said, ‘You shall not commit adultery.’",
   "28": "But I say to you that whoever looks at a woman to lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.",
   "29": "So if your right eye is causing you to fall, tear it out and throw it away; because it is better for you that one of your members perish than that your whole body be thrown into hell.",
   "30": "And if your right hand is causing you to fall, cut it off and throw it away; because it is better for you that one of your members perish than that your whole body be thrown into hell.",
   "31": "It was said, ‘Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.’",
   "32": "But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for a case of fornication, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery.",
   "33": "“Again you have heard that it was said to the ancients: ‘You shall not swear falsely, but you shall perform your oaths to the Lord.’",
   "34": "But I say to you not to swear at all: neither by heaven, because it is God's throne;",
   "35": "nor by the earth, because it is a stool for His feet; nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King.",
   "36": "Nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black.",
   "37": "But let your word be ‘yes yes’, ‘no no’; for whatever is more than these is from the malignant one.",
   "38": "“You have heard that it was said: ‘An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.’",
   "39": "But I say to you not to resist the evildoer; but whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.",
   "40": "“And if someone wants to sue you and take your tunic, let him have the cloak as well.",
   "41": "And whoever compels you to go one mile, go with him two.",
   "42": "Give to him who asks you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you.",
   "43": "“You have heard that it was said: ‘You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.’",
   "44": "But I say to you: love your enemies, bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you, and pray for those who mistreat you and persecute you,",
   "45": "that you may prove to be sons of your Father in the heavens; for He makes His sun rise on the evil and on the good, and He sends rain on the just and the unjust.",
   "46": "For if you love those who love you, what reward have you? Do not even the tax collectors do the same?",
   "47": "And if you greet only your friends, what are you doing extra? Do not even the tax collectors do so?",

   "10": "But so that you may know that the Son of the Man has authority on the earth to forgive sins”—He says to the paralytic:",
   "11": "“To you I say, get up, pick up your pallet and go to your house!”",
   "12": "So forthwith he got up, picked up his pallet and went out in front of them all; so that all were amazed and glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this!”",
   "13": "Then He went out again by the sea; and the whole crowd came to Him, and He began to teach them.",
   "14": "As He passed by, He saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax office, and He said to him, “Follow me!” So he got up and followed Him.",
   "15": "Now it happened, as He was reclining at the table in his house, that many tax collectors and sinners joined Jesus and His disciples at the table; for there were many and they followed Him.",
   "16": "The scribes and the Pharisees, seeing Him eating with the tax collectors and sinners, said to His disciples, “Why is it that He is eating and drinking with the tax collectors and sinners?”",
   "17": "Upon hearing it Jesus said to them: “It is not the healthy who have need of a doctor, but those who are sick. I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.”",
   "18": "Now John's disciples and those of the Pharisees were fasting; and they came and said to Him, “Why do John's disciples and those of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not?”",
   "19": "So Jesus said to them: “Can the groomsmen fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom to themselves they cannot fast.",
   "20": "But the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast, in those days.",
   "21": "“Further, no one sews a patch of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, or else the new tears away some of the old, and a worse hole results.",
   "22": "And no one puts new wine into old wineskins, or else the new wine bursts the wineskins, the wine spills out and the skins will be ruined; rather, new wine must be put into new wineskins.”",
   "23": "Now it happened, on a Sabbath, that He was passing through some grain fields, and His disciples began to make a path, picking the heads of grain.",
   "24": "So the Pharisees said to Him, “Just look, why are they doing on a Sabbath that which is not permitted?”",
   "25": "And He said to them: “Did you never read what David did when he was in need and hungry, he and those with him?",
   "26": "How he entered the house of God (making Abiathar high priest) and ate the consecrated bread, which only priests are permitted to eat, and shared it with those who were with him?”",
   "27": "Then He said to them: “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.",

   "3": "Well, He says to the man with the withered hand, “Come out in the middle!”",
   "4": "Then He said to them: “Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do evil, to save life or to kill?” But they remained silent.",
   "5": "After looking around at them with anger, being grieved at the hardness of their hearts, He says to the man, “Stretch out your hand!” So he stretched, and his hand was restored as healthy as the other!",

   "7": "Jesus withdrew with His disciples to the sea; and a large crowd from Galilee followed Him—also from Judea,",
   "8": "from Jerusalem, from Idumea and beyond Jordan; even those around Tyre and Sidon. A huge crowd came to Him, having heard the sorts of things He kept doing.",
   "9": "So He told His disciples that a small boat should be kept ready for Him because of the crowd, lest they should press in on Him.",
   "10": "Because He had healed many, so that as many as had afflictions were pushing toward Him so as to touch Him.",
   "11": "And the unclean spirits—whenever one saw Him, he would fall down before Him and cry out, saying, “You are the son of God!”",
   "12": "And He kept giving them strict orders that they should not make Him known.",

   "16": "namely Peter (a name He gave to Simon);",
   "17": "James son of Zebedee, and John the brother of James (and a name He gave to them was Boanerges, that is, ‘Sons of thunder’);",

   "22": "Then some scribes who had come down from Jerusalem started saying, “He has Beelzebul,” and “It is by the ruler of the demons that he casts out demons.”",
   "23": "So summoning them He started saying to them in parables: “How can Satan cast out Satan?",
   "24": "If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.",
   "25": "And if a household is divided against itself, that household cannot stand.",
   "26": "And if Satan has risen up against himself and become divided, he cannot stand, but is finished.",
   "27": "No one can plunder the strong man's goods, invading his house, unless he first binds the strong man—then he may plunder the house.",
   "28": "“Assuredly I say to you: all the sins of the sons of men can be forgiven, including whatever blasphemies they may utter;",
   "29": "but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is subject to eternal condemnation”",

   "32": "A crowd was sitting around Him; so they said to Him, “Look, your mother and your brothers and your sisters are outside asking for you.”",
   "33": "He answered them saying, “Who is my mother or my brothers?”",
   "34": "And looking around at those seated in a circle around Him He said: “Behold my mother and my brothers!",

   "4": "And it happened, as he sowed, that some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it.",
   "5": "Some fell on the rocky area where it did not have much soil, and it sprang up quickly because it had no depth of soil.",
   "6": "But upon the sun's rising it was scorched, and because it had no root it was withered up.",
   "7": "And some fell among the thorns, and the thorns grew up and smothered it, and it yielded no fruit.",
   "8": "And some fell into the good ground, and coming up and growing it started to produce fruit—yielding thirty times as much, sixty times as much, even a hundred times as much.”",
   "9": "Then He said, “He who has ears to hear, let him hear!”",
   "10": "But when He was alone, those who were around Him, with the twelve, asked Him about the parable.",
   "11": "So He said to them: “To you it has been given to know the mystery of the Kingdom of God; but to those who are outside, everything is being given in parables,",
   "12": "so that: ‘Seeing they may see, and not perceive; and hearing they may hear, and not understand; so that they should not return and their sins be forgiven them.’”",
   "13": "Then He said to them: “Don't you understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables?",
   "14": "The sower sows the Word.",
   "15": "These are the ones where the Word is sown along the path: as soon as they hear it, Satan comes and takes away the Word that was sown in their hearts.",
   "16": "Similarly, these are the ones sown on the rocky area: as soon as they hear the Word they receive it with joy,",
   "17": "but since they have no root in themselves they are temporary—when oppression or persecution comes because of the Word, they quickly fall away.",
   "18": "And these are the ones sown among the thorns: they hear the Word,",
   "19": "but the worries of this age, the deceitfulness of wealth, and the undue desires for other things come in and smother the Word, and it becomes unfruitful.",
   "20": "And these are the ones sown on the good ground: such people hear the Word, welcome it and produce fruit—thirty times as much, sixty times as much, even a hundred times as much.”",
   "21": "Also He said to them: “The lamp is not brought to be put under a box or under a bed, is it? Is it not to be placed on its stand?",
   "22": "For there is no ‘hidden’ that may not be exposed, nor has anything been concealed but that it should come to light.",
   "23": "If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear!”",
   "24": "Then He said to them: “Pay attention to what you hear. With the same measure you use it will be measured to you in return; and to you who hear, more will be added.",
   "25": "Because whoever has, to him more will be given; whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him.”",

   "28": "All by itself the earth produces fruit: first a shoot, then a head of grain, then full grain in the head.",
   "29": "But as soon as the grain is ready, he sends in the sickle, because the harvest has come.”",
   "30": "Again He said: “To what shall we compare the Kingdom of God, or with what sort of parable should we illustrate it?",
   "31": "It is like a mustard seed, that when it is sown on the ground is the smallest of all such seeds,",
   "32": "yet when it is sown, it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden herbs and produces big branches, so that the birds of the air are able to rest in its shade.”",
   "33": "It was with many such parables that He was speaking the word to them, as they were able to hear it.",
   "34": "But apart from a parable He did not speak to them; privately, however, He would explain everything to His disciples.",
   "35": "On the same day, when evening had come, He said to them, “Let us go across to the other side.”",
   "36": "Since He was already in the boat, they took off with Him, leaving the crowd behind (other little boats were also with Him).",
   "37": "Well a strong cyclonic wind came up, such that the waves beat into the boat, so that it was already filling up.",
   "38": "But He was on the poop deck, sleeping on the cushion; so they awakened Him and said to Him, “Teacher, don't you care that we are perishing?”",
   "39": "Then, having been awakened, He rebuked the wind and said to the sea, “Shut up; be muzzled!” So the wind stopped and there was a complete calm.",
   "40": "And He said to them: “Why are you so afraid? How is it that you have no faith?”",

   "5": "Always, night and day, in the tombs and in the mountains, he was crying out and cutting himself with stones.—",
   "6": "When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and kneeled down to Him,",
   "7": "and with a loud cry he said: “What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I implore you by God, don't torment me!”",
   "8": "Because He was saying to him, “You unclean spirit, come out of the man!”",
   "9": "Then He asked him, “What is your name?” And he answered, saying, “Legion is my name, because we are many.”",
   "10": "He started begging Him repeatedly that He would not send them out of that region.",
   "11": "Now a large herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside.",
   "12": "So all the demons begged Him saying, “Send us into the pigs, so that we may enter them.”",
   "13": "And forthwith Jesus gave them permission; and coming out the unclean spirits went into the pigs (there were about two thousand); but the herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea, and they were drowned by the sea.",
   "14": "So those who were tending the pigs ran off and reported it in the town and the countryside. And they went out to see what it was that had happened.",
   "15": "They came to Jesus and observed the man who had been demonized, who had the legion, sitting and clothed and in his right mind; and they were afraid.",
   "16": "Those who had seen it related to them how it happened to the demonized man, and about the pigs.",
   "17": "Then they began to implore Him to depart from their borders.",
   "18": "Well upon His getting into the boat, the man who had been demonized started begging Him that he might be with Him.",
   "19": "But Jesus did not permit him, but said to him, “Go home to your family and report to them how much the Lord has done for you; and He had mercy on you.”",
   "20": "So he departed and began to proclaim in Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him; and all were marveling.",
   "21": "Now when Jesus had crossed over again by boat to the other side, a large crowd gathered to Him; and He was by the sea.",
   "22": "And then, one of the synagogue rulers, named Jairus, comes, and upon finding Him he falls at His feet",
   "23": "and pleads earnestly with Him, saying, “My little daughter is at the point of death; do come and lay your hands on her so that she may be saved, and she will live.”",
   "24": "So He went with him. A large crowd was also following Him, and they were pressing around Him.",
   "25": "Now a certain woman—who had been bleeding for twelve years,",
   "26": "and had suffered many things under many doctors, and had spent all that she had, yet instead of getting better she grew worse—",
   "27": "when she heard about Jesus, she came from behind in the crowd and touched His garment.",

   "29": "Immediately the flow of her blood was dried up, and she knew in her body that she was healed from the affliction.",
   "30": "And instantly Jesus perceived within Himself that some power had gone out of Him, and turning around in the crowd He said, “Who touched my clothes?”",
   "31": "So His disciples said to Him, “You see the crowd pressing around you, yet you say, ‘Who touched me?’?”",
   "32": "But He kept looking around to see who had done it.",
   "33": "So the woman, fearing and trembling, knowing what had happened to her, came and fell down before Him and told Him the whole truth.",
   "34": "And He said to her: “Daughter, your faith has saved you. Go into peace and be healed from your affliction.”",
   "35": "While He was still speaking, they came from the synagogue ruler's house saying: “Your daughter died. Why trouble the teacher further?”",
   "36": "But immediately upon hearing the spoken message Jesus said to the synagogue ruler, “Don't be afraid; just believe!”",
   "37": "He allowed no one to follow Him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.",
   "38": "Then He came to the synagogue ruler's house and found a commotion—weeping and loud wailing.",
   "39": "So upon entering He said to them: “Why are you making such a commotion and weeping? The child is not dead, but is asleep.”",
   "40": "But they started ridiculing Him. After He put them all out, He took the child's father and mother, and those with Him, and went in where the child was lying.",
   "41": "And taking the child by the hand He said to her, “Talitha koumi,” which is translated, “Little girl, I say to you, get up!”",
   "42": "Immediately the girl got up and started walking around (she was twelve years old). And they were overcome with great amazement.",

  "6": {
   "1": "Then He went out from there and came to His hometown, and His disciples followed Him.",

   "3": "Isn't this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James, Joses, Judas and Simon? And aren't his sisters here with us?” So they took offense at Him.",

   "5": "He could do no mighty work there, except that He laid His hands on a few sick people and healed them.",
   "6": "And He marveled at their unbelief. Then He went about the villages in a circuit, teaching.",
   "7": "Then He summoned the twelve and began to send them out, two by two, giving them authority over the unclean spirits as He did so.",

   "12": "So they went out and started preaching that people should repent,",
   "13": "and they were casting out many demons, and anointing with oil and healing many who were sick.",

   "19": "So Herodias nursed a grudge against him and wanted to kill him; but she couldn't,",

   "8": "Well they ate and were filled; they even took up seven hampers of broken pieces that were left over.",

   "59": "Then He said to another, “Follow me!” But he said, “Lord, permit me first to go and bury my father.”",

   "61": "And another also said, “I will follow you, Lord, but first allow me to bid farewell to those who are at my house.”",

   "19": "Further, if I am casting out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges.",

   "1": "Then some men came down from Judea and started teaching the brothers, “Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved.”",
   "2": "Well this provoked serious dissension and argument between Paul and Barnabas and them, so Paul and Barnabas were appointed, along with certain others of them, to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and elders about this question.",
   "3": "So being sent on their way by the congregation, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, describing the conversion of the Gentiles; and they caused great joy to all the brothers.",

   "7": "When there had been plenty of discussion, Peter got up and said to them: “Men, brothers, you know that a good while ago God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the message of the Gospel and believe.",
   "8": "And the heart-knowing God acknowledged them by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as He did to us;",

   "23": "They wrote by their hand the following: “The apostles and the elders and the brothers, to the Gentile brothers in Antioch, Syria and Cilicia: Greetings.",
   "24": "Since we have heard that some who went out from among us have disturbed you with words, unsettling your souls, saying that you must be circumcised and keep the Law—to whom we gave no such authorization—",

   "15": "When she and her household were baptized, she appealed saying, “If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay.” So she persuaded us.",
   "16": "Now it happened, as we were going to prayer, that a certain slave girl having a spirit of divination met us, who brought considerable profit to her owners by divination.",
   "17": "Following Paul and Silas this girl kept calling out, “These men are servants of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to us the way of salvation!”",
   "18": "She kept this up for many days! So Paul, becoming increasingly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, “I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!” And it came out that very hour.",

   "10": "Immediately, during the night, the brothers sent both Paul and Silas away to Berea; on arriving they went into the synagogue of the Jews.",
   "11": "Now these were more noble-minded than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all goodwill, examining the Scriptures daily to see whether these things might be so.",
   "12": "Therefore many of them believed, and also not a few of the Greeks, prominent women as well as men.",
   "13": "But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the Word of God was also being proclaimed by Paul in Berea, they came too, agitating the crowds.",

   "15": "But those who were conducting Paul actually took him all the way to Athens; and receiving a command to Silas and Timothy that they should come to him as quickly as possible, they started back.",
   "16": "Now while Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was increasingly aroused within him as he observed that the city was full of idols.",
   "17": "So he reasoned both in the synagogue with the Jews and devout persons, and in the marketplace day by day with those who happened to be there.",
   "18": "Then certain philosophers, both Epicureans and Stoics, encountered him. Some said, “What might this idea-scavenger want to say?” Others said, “He seems to be a proclaimer of foreign deities”—because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection.",
   "19": "So taking him in tow they led him to the Areopagus and said: “May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?",

   "24": "The God who made the world and everything in it, since He is Lord of heaven and earth, does not dwell in temples built by hands,",

   "30": "Such times of ignorance God did indeed overlook, but now He commands all people everywhere to repent,",

   "25": "This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in the Spirit he was speaking and teaching accurately the things concerning Jesus, although he knew only the baptism of John.",

   "27": "When he decided to go across into Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to receive him; upon arriving he was a great help to those who had believed through the Grace;",

   "7": "I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, ‘Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?’",

   "11": "Now the following night the Lord stood by him and said, “Take courage, Paul, because as you have testified about me in Jerusalem, so you must also testify in Rome.”",
   "12": "And when it was day, some of the Jews formed a conspiracy by binding themselves with a curse neither to eat nor to drink until they had destroyed Paul.",

   "16": "But when Paul's sister's son heard about the ambush, he went and entered the barracks and told Paul.",
   "17": "So Paul called one of the centurions and said, “Take this young man to the commander, because he has something to tell him.”",

   "18": "to open their eyes, so as to bring them back from darkness into light and from the authority of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and an inheritance among those who are sanctified, by faith into me.’",

   "40": "Casting off the anchors they left them in the sea, at the same time untying the rudder ropes; and hoisting the foresail to the wind, they made for the beach.",
   "41": "But they fell into a place where two seas met and ran the vessel aground; the prow stuck fast and remained immovable, but the stern began to be broken up by the violence of the waves.",
   "42": "Now the plan of the soldiers was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim away and escape.",
   "43": "But the centurion, wanting to save Paul, stopped them from doing it and ordered those who could swim to jump in first and go toward the land,",
